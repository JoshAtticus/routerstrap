# Huawei E585
The dashboard for this router is currently WIP

## What's shown
- Nothing yet

## How to use
1. Install & Activate CORS Unblock: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-unblock/) [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino) [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cors-unblock/hkjklmhkbkdhlgnnfbbcihcajofmjgbh)
2. Open routerstrap for this router

## Limitations
- This router's API has CORS, therefore CORS Unblock is required to function
- It is impossible to get a token for admin permissions without dev tools, so editing settings, viewing wifi details etc is not possible as of now
